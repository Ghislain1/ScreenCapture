This is a working example of a screen capture app, but it doesn't save the video stream, only shows preview - https://github.com/microsoft/Windows.UI.Composition-Win32-Samples/tree/master/dotnet/WPF/ScreenCapture

The project task is simple -

1. Modify this sample (BasicCapture.cs class) to save the video stream to a mp4 file in the local videos library.
2. Add comments wherever you have modified code
3. Send me a zip of the new working project.

Potential for a long term contract for similar tasks on a weekly basis.
